This R project contains all of the code and data to run the analysis in the manuscript "Response of individual size distributions to environmental temperature
in streams across North America" by Justin Pomeranz, James Junker, and Jeff Wesner. 

Please address any questions to the corresponding author, Justin Pomeranz, at jfpomeranz@gmail.com 

The scripts to run the analysis are located in the "scripts" folder, and should be run in order (e.g., 1_dl_wrangle...R, 2_mat_c_....R). The "custom_functions.R" script contains functions written for this analysis and is sourced within analysis scripts where needed. 

To recreate the analysis and figures presented in the manuscript, start with the analysis in script 2. This will load all of the data which was downloaded from the NEON website on October 26th 2020. The appropriate data objects can de found in the "data" folder in this project. 

The NEON data portal is a live site which is subject to new data uploads on a continuous basis. To download the most up-to-date data from NEON and calculate dry mass from length weight regressions, run script 1.
