This R project contains all of the code and data to run the analysis in the manuscript "Spatiotemporal variability of abundance size-spectra in streams across North America" by Justin Pomeranz and Jeff Wesner. 

Please address any questions to the corresponding author, Justin Pomeranz, at jfpomeranz@gmail.com 

The scripts to run the analysis are located in the "scripts" folder, and should be run in order (e.g., 1_dl_wrangle...R, 2_mat_c_....R). The "custom_functions.R" script contains functions written for this analysis and is sourced within analysis scripts where needed. 

To download the data from NEON and calculate dry mass from length weight regressions, run script 1. Alternatvely, you can skip straight to the analysis in script 2 by loading the "macro_dw.RDS" file in the "data" folder. This data was downloaded on October 26th 2020, and is the data that is analyzed and presented in the manuscript.
